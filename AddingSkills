In Google Antigravity, "Skills" are modular capabilities that tell the AI agent how to perform specific tasks, what tools to use, and what rules to follow. You insert them by placing a folder containing a SKILL.md file into specific directories on your machine.
+1 Here is how to add them for your specific project versus globally:

a) My Project (Workspace Scope)
If you want a skill to be available only within a specific coding project (e.g., a custom deployment script or a specific database query tool for that app), use the workspace directory.
Navigate to your project's root folder.
Create a hidden directory named .agent (if it doesn't exist).
Inside that, create a skills folder.
Insert your skill: Create a new folder for your skill and add a SKILL.md file inside it.
Path: <your-project-root>/.agent/skills/your-skill-name/SKILL.md

b) Antigravity Global (Global Scope)
If you want a skill to be available across all projects you open in Antigravity (e.g., a "Format JSON" utility or a "Code Review" standard), use the global directory.
Open your file explorer or terminal.
Navigate to your home directory's Gemini folder.
Insert your skill: Create a folder for the skill and add the SKILL.md file.
MacOS/Linux: ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/your-skill-name/SKILL.md
Windows: C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.gemini\antigravity\skills\your-skill-name\SKILL.md

Basic SKILL.md Template
For the agent to "pick up" the skill, the file must start with specific metadata (YAML frontmatter). Here is a simple example:
Markdown

---
name: my-custom-tool
description: Use this skill when you need to [describe the specific trigger].
---

# My Custom Tool
Provide detailed instructions here for the agent. 

## Instructions
1. Run the script located in ./scripts/run.py
2. Capture the output and summarize it for the user.

## Constraints
- Do not modify any files in the /config folder.
Key Tips for Success
The Description is the Trigger: The description field in the header is what the agent uses to decide when to activate the skill. Be very specific about when it should be used.

Automatic Activation: You don't usually need to "call" the skill. If you ask Antigravity to "Deploy the app," it will look through your skill descriptions to find one that matches that goal.

Refresh: After adding a new skill folder, you may need to restart your Antigravity agent session for it to index the new capabilit
